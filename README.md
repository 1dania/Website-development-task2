# Web Form with Status Toggle

This project is a simple web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and MySQL.

It demonstrates how to:
- Create a form with name, age, and submit button
- Store the submitted data into a MySQL database
- Display all records in a table
- Add a toggle button for each record to switch the status between 0 and 1
- Update the status immediately on the page using AJAX

## 🌐 How It Works

1. The user submits their name and age through a form.
2. The data is sent to a PHP script which inserts it into a MySQL database.
3. All records are displayed below the form in a table.
4. Each row has a Toggle button which updates the status (0 → 1 or 1 → 0) without reloading the page.
